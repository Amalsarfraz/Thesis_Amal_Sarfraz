name: A Robust Two-step Method for Clustering and Dealing with Outlier Sets in Big
  Data
description: This paper addresses the need for a computationally efficient method
  to automate the identification of outliers in low-dimensional subsets of terabyte-scale
  datasets. Our novel methodology, Outlier Set Two-step Identification, employs a
  two-step approach to identify and label clustered groups of anomalous points as
  single entities, which we term “outlier sets.”
